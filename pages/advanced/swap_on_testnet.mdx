# Swapping on Testnet

Swapping on the testnet is a great way to test out the swap functionality without risking your mainnet assets. The testnet is a separate network from the mainnet, and the assets on the testnet are worthless.
To be exact, `testnet3` bitcoin will be swapped for `stagenet` Monero. You will need to set up two wallets to perform a swap:

- A Testnet3 Electrum Wallet (Bitcoin)
- A Stagenet Monero GUI Wallet

## Electrum

Download Electrum from the official [site](https://electrum.org/#download) and then start the wallet with the `--testnet` flag.

### Linux

```
./electrum --testnet
```

### Mac OS:

```
open -n /Applications/Electrum.app --args --testnet
```

### Windows:

If you install Electrum on Windows, you will have two programs you can start. One of them is called "Electrum Testnet".

### Getting testnet coins

To get some free Testnet coins visit a faucet like [this](https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co) one.

## Monero

If you use the `monero-wallet-cli` you simply need to start it with the `--stagenet` flag. If you use the GUI you can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E4aO3UAqJo) tutorial by the COMIT guys.

You can use this remote note:

```
stagenet.melo.tools:38081
```

## Installing the GUI

View the [Installation Instructions](../getting_started/install_instructions) if you haven't already installed the GUI.

## Making a swap

Start the GUI with the environment variable `TESTNET=true`. From here on you can follow the [Complete your first Atomic Swap](../usage/first_swap) guide with the difference that you will be using the testnet wallets. The process is the same, but you will be using the testnet wallets instead of the mainnet wallets.
