# How to complete your first Atomic Swap

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of completing your first atomic swap using the UnstoppableSwap GUI.
Although the process is quite intuitive, there are some nuances to be aware of, so we'll cover everything you need to know to get started.

## Prerequisites
To complete an Atomic Swap, you'll need to have the following:
1. A Monero wallet you can use to receive funds
2. A Bitcoin wallet you can use with some funds in it. This wallet should also be able to generate a native SegWit address (an address starting with `bc1`). This address will be used to receive the refunded BTC if the swap is not completed.
3. The UnstoppableSwap GUI installed on your computer. We'll refer to this as GUI from now on. View the [Installation Instructions](../getting_started/install_instructions) if you haven't already installed the GUI.

## Step 1: Choose a _Swap Provider_ to swap with
After opening the GUI, you'll be greeted with the main screen. In the bottom of the widget in the middle of the screen you can see the currently selected _Swap Provider_. This is who you'll sent your Bitcoin to and who you'll receive the Monero from. You can change the _Swap Provider_ by clicking on the arrow and selecting a different _Swap Provider_ from the list.

The _Swap Providers_ offer different exchange rates and differing amounts of liquidity, so you may want to choose a _Swap Provider_ that best suits your needs.

You can use the text field to calculate the approximate amount of Monero you'll receive for a given amount of Bitcoin. The final rate however will differ and will be shown in a later step.

## Step 2: Start the Swap
Once you've selected a _Swap Provider_, you can start the swap by clicking the `Swap` button. This will open a new window where you need to enter the receiving Monero address and the Bitcoin address refunds will be sent to if the swap is not completed successfully.
