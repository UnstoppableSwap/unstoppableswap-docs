# _Swap Provider_ discovery

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of discovering _Swap Providers_ using the UnstoppableSwap GUI. 
A _Swap Provider_ is a service run by an anonymous entity that offers to sell Monero in exchange for Bitcoin.

There are two ways to discover _Swap Providers_:
1. **Public Registry**: Community volunteers maintain a list of _Swap Providers_ that is provided to the GUI and is automatically updated. This list is displayed in the GUI by default. The _Public Registry_ also stores additional information about the _Swap Providers_ such as their uptime and age, and makes it available to the GUI.
2. **Rendezvous**: The GUI can discover Swap Providers using the Rendezvous protocol. This protocol enables the GUI to find providers that register themselves at a rendezvous point. The GUI can query these points to get a list of registered providers. These rendezvous points are operated by community volunteers, and anyone can run one. The GUI can connect to various rendezvous points to discover different providers.

## How to discover _Swap Providers_ via the Rendezvous protocol

1. Open the _Swap Provider_ list by clicking the right-facing arrow in the widget on the _Swap_ tab.

    height: "1lh",
    display: "inline-block",
    // center vertically
    verticalAlign: "middle",
}}/> button to open the _Discover swap providers_ dialog. Enter the _Multiaddress_ of the rendezvous point you want to connect to. You can also choose one of the predefined rendezvous points from the list below the Textfield. Click the _Connect_ button to connect to the rendezvous point.

## How to add a _Swap Provider_ to the _Public Registry_

If you know of a _Swap Provider_ that is not yet in the _Public Registry_, you can submit it manually. Here's how you can do it:
1. Open the _Swap Provider_ list by clicking the right-facing arrow in the widget on the _Swap_ tab.

    height: "1lh",
    display: "inline-block",
    // center vertically
    verticalAlign: "middle",
}}/> button to open the _Submit a provider to the public registry_ dialog. Enter the _Multiaddress_ of the _Swap Provider_ as well as the _Peer ID_ of the provider. Click the _Submit_ button to submit the provider to the _Public Registry_.
